EBS vs Instance Store
---------------------
- Some instances do not come with root EBS volumes
    - Instead they come with 'instance store' (ephemeral storage)
- Instance store is physically attached to the machine
- EBS is a network drive
- Instance store pros:
    - Better I/O because there is no network
    - Good for buffer / cache / scrath data / temporary content
    - Data survives reboots
- Instance store cons:
    - On stop or termination the instance store is lost
    - Cannot resize on the fly like we can EBS volumes
    - Backups must be operated by the user
