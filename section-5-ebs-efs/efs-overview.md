EFS Overview
------------
- Elastic File System
- Managed network file system (NFS) that can be mounted on many EC2 instances-
- Works with instances in multiple AZs
- Highly available, scalable, and expensive
    - About 3x more that GP2
- Pay per use, not provisioned cost
    - Can therefore work out cheaper than GP2 if managed with care
- EFS fronted by a security group, which can be configured to allow access
  to EC2 instances.
- Use cases:
    - content management
    - web serving
    - data sharing
    - wordpress
- Uses NFSv4.1 protocal
- Compatible with Lunix AMIs, but not windows
- Performance mode
    - General purpose (default)
    - Max I/O - used when thousands of EC2 using the EFS
- EFS finle sync: sync on prem file system to EFS
- Backup EFS to EFS (incremental, can choose frequency)
- Can encrypt at rest with KMS
