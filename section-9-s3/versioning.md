Versioning
----------
- Versioning has to be enabled at the bucket level
- Overwriting a file increments its version
- Bucket keeps all versions
- Best practice to enable
    - Protect against accidental deletes
    - Easily rollback to previous version
- Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version 'null'
- Deleting a versioned file will not remove it from the bucket, it will just add a 'delete marker' against the latest version
    - This can be restored to remove the delete marker
